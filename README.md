## 📌 Overview

Simple Rentals is a web application designed to simplify the process of finding rentals, roommates, and group housing. Users can:

- 🎯 **Post rentals**, adding all the information you want to make your listing stand out!
- 🔍 **Search and Filter listings** by items such as location, property type, price, etc. Helping you find your perfect fit!
- 🔝 **Create a roommate profile** so that others also looking for a roommate can connect with you!
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Search for your ideal roommate** using advanced search & filtering.
- 💬 **Chat and connect!** Contact owners or form groups to rent together.
- ✍ **Voice your opinion!** Leave reviews about your experiences with other users.
- 🤖 **Get personalized recommendations** based on your activity on the platform! Our ML model (built with ```sklearn```) looks at your interactions and maps what listings might be of the most interest to you.

Built with a Django + PostgreSQL backend and a Vite + React + Bootstrap frontend, the platform is fully containerized, tested, and deployed with continuous integration and delivery.
